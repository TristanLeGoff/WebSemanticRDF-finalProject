# WebSemanticRDF-finalProject

This is a React project with Nextjs.
To try it you have to have a Apache Jena Fuseki database on your locolhost.
Then you can do : npm install
Finally : npm run dev

This is a demo it is not complete.
For now you can type the insee code of the departure city and the insee code of arrival city and go. (Little bug with Paris for now so try another city)
Example : 92026 (for Courbevoie) and 35238 (for Rennes)

That will return the shorter route with the sncf network.
It will also give you some informations like the meteo.
